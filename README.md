What are the cumulative number of cases and deaths for both viruses? Which countries were the most affected?

In our research we found that during the SARS outbreak of 2003 there were 8,460 confirmed cases compared to the 28,652 confirmed cases reported during the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. While both viruses are infectious they were mainly contained to East Asia (SARS) and Western Africa (Ebola). 


Are there differences in mortality rate for each disease? Does healthcare systems have an impact on total cases and deaths?

When comparing both viruses we had to acknowledge the difference in outbreak periods. Since Ebola lasted more than a year longer than SARS we asked the question, does the infected country's healthcare play a role in the virus’ ability to spread? This brought us to research the pandemic preparedness score that assesses a country’s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to significant disease outbreaks. We found that Ebola affected countries had a lower score, sub 39, than  SARS countries, 48-84. This led us to assume that Ebola infected countries were exposed to a longer outbreak due to the lack of quality healthcare available.
To gather meaningful data to answer our questions we focused on countries with over 100 reported cases of SARS and Ebola. To assess the difference in the mortality rate and recovery rate we compared cases and deaths per 10,000 of the population. As expected SARS showed lower cases, .55 per 10,000, and deaths, .09 per 10,000. Ebola showed 16 cases per 10,00 and 6 deaths per 10,000.


How prevalent are these viruses in the countries they affect?

The results of our findings support our hypothesis with Ebola showing more cumulative cases and deaths. Population density doesn’t seem to have an affect on the spreadability of the disease as countries infected with SARS have a higher population than Ebola infected countries. However we should note that our data doesn’t take into account the safety guidelines put in place to contain the outbreak. Evaluating the r0 value and health index score is a good way to assess the spreadability of the virus in various countries. Health Index determines the quality of the healthcare infrastructure and while R0 determines spreadability. For example China and Hong Kong had a similar amount of cases but because the population was more dense in Hong Kong, which lead to a higher r0 value. Where the r0 is higher it’s important for the country to have a higher health index score to combat the spread of the virus. If we compare the health index and r0 value of countries infected with Ebola and SARS we see that there are similar r0 values but Ebola countries have lower health index scores.
