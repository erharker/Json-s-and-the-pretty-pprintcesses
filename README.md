In the midst of the current pandemic, we wanted to evaluate past viral outbreaks to study the effects of population and spreadability on mortality rates. In this analysis we focused on two recent outbreaks, Ebola outbreak in West Africa from  2014-2016 and the SARS outbreak in 2003.

## What are the cumulative number of cases and deaths for both viruses? Which countries were the most affected?

  In our research we found that during the SARS outbreak of 2003 there were 8,460 confirmed cases compared to the 28,652 confirmed cases reported during the Ebola outbreak of 2014-2016. While both viruses are infectious they were mainly contained to East Asia (SARS) and Western Africa (Ebola). During our research we found that both outbreaks spread to various countries around the world but they were mainly concentrated in a few countries. For example SARS was reported in 36 countries but only had 6 countries with over 100 cumulative cases. Similarly Ebola cases were reported in 10 countries but on 3 showed significant cases.



## Are there differences in mortality rate for each disease? Does healthcare systems have an impact on total cases and deaths?

  When comparing both viruses we had to acknowledge the difference in outbreak periods. Since Ebola lasted more than a year longer than SARS we asked the question, does the infected country's healthcare play a role in the virus’ ability to spread? This brought us to research the pandemic preparedness score that assesses a country’s ability to prevent, detect, and respond to significant disease outbreaks. We found that Ebola affected countries had a lower score, sub 39, than  SARS countries, 48-84. This led us to assume that Ebola infected countries were exposed to a longer outbreak due to the lack of quality healthcare available.
To gather meaningful data to answer our questions we focused on countries with over 100 reported cases of SARS and Ebola. To assess the difference in the mortality rate and recovery rate we compared cases and deaths per 10,000 of the population. As expected SARS showed lower cases, .55 per 10,000, and deaths, .09 per 10,000. Ebola showed 16 cases per 10,00 and 6 deaths per 10,000.


## How prevalent are these viruses in the countries they affect?

  The results of our findings support our hypothesis with Ebola showing more cumulative cases and deaths. Population density doesn’t seem to have an affect on the spreadability of the disease as countries infected with SARS have a higher population than Ebola infected countries. However we should note that our data doesn’t take into account the safety guidelines put in place to contain the outbreak. Evaluating the r0 value and health index score is a good way to assess the spreadability of the virus in various countries. Health Index determines the quality of the healthcare infrastructure and while R0 determines spreadability. For example China and Hong Kong had a similar amount of cases but because the population was more dense in Hong Kong, which lead to a higher r0 value. Where the r0 is higher it’s important for the country to have a higher health index score to combat the spread of the virus. If we compare the health index and r0 value of countries infected with Ebola and SARS we see that there are similar r0 values but Ebola countries have lower health index scores. 

## Conclusions

  Although both diseases were deadly, Ebola had a far greater impact the top 3 affected countries than SARS had. It should also be noted that there were a handful of Ebola cases in other countires but outbreaks did not occur. This can likely be attributed to better health care infrastructure in place that were able to limit the spread of Ebola. The SARS outbreak was better contained because it had fewer deaths and lasted a shorter amount of time. It is liekly tthat SARS is a less deadly disease overall, but it was also spread to more countries. The shorter outbreak period around the world shows countries were better prepared to treat and stop the disease. It shows that the prepareness of healthcare systems arround the world are vital in stopping outbreaks.
